# shell
CS 240 Final Project
Introduction to Machine Organization with Laboratory

A simple `bash` shell. Interprets command language and manages processes.
  1) Uses process control features of the operating system (`fork`, `execvp`, `waitpid`, etc.)
  2) Manages basic concurrency of foreground and background processes
  3) Uses simple C data structures

In this project, we practiced our debugging skills (using `gdb` and `valgrind`), read documentation to find relevant library functions, and inreased our proficiency with C and systems programming.
